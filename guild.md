A new guild in Darkages was formed on January 8th, 2024 at around 10:07 AM MT. Its name is `Sradagan`, which means `little sparks` in Gaelic, and its primary goal is to help new or returning players in the world of Darkages!

Feel free to reach out to `PaladinJack` (guild leader) or `Protein` (someday council) in-game, if you have any questions about the guild or are curious about how to join!
