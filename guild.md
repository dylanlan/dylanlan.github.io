A new guild of Aislings in Darkages was formed on January 8th, 2024 at around 10:07 AM MT. Its name is `Sradagan`, which means `little sparks` in Gaelic, and its primary goal is to help new or returning players in the world of Darkages!

Here's an example Sradagan adventure, if you're curious what shenanigans we get up to!
