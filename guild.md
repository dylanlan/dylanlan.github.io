`Sradagan` is a new guild of Aislings in Darkages, which formed on January 8th, 2024 at around 10:07 AM MT, and recreated on February 1st, 2024. Its name means `little sparks` in Gaelic, and its primary goal is to help new or returning players in the world of Darkages!

Here's an example Sradagan Adventure, if you're curious what shenanigans we get up to!
