This is just an early alpha side project focused on figuring out which Aislings hold various interesting records!

The hope is to have a collection of verifiable and beatable records, showcasing some of the most impressive Aislings across Temuair!

(( If anyone has any ideas about how to discourage botting for these records, I'm all ears!! ))

# Legend Mark Records
Here's a collection of records related to an increasing number on an Aisling's legend. They should be verifiable by viewing the Aisling's legend.

If you contact me about a record that you might own and let me take a screenshot of your legend, I can add you to this list!

### Admitted Citizens
Malache currently has this record, at 217 admitted citizens. This is back from Deoch 61, and almost certainly out of date!

### Adorations
BioMagus has the most Adorations. It's not even close.

### Arena Battles

### Arena Victory Loss Rate
Which Aisling has the worst arena battle victory rate? Coming soon!

(Probably need a minimum number of battles for this one, to not get skewed by small sample sizes)

### Arena Victory Win Rate
Acesin has an impressive arena battle win rate! 938/1621, which is roughly 58%. Better than a coin flip!
