This is just an early alpha side project focused on figuring out which Aisling holds various interesting records!

If you contact Protein, NaLyd, or Dylanlan about a record that you might own, and let me take a screenshot of your legend, you might be rewarded with a bright, glowing prize!!

The hope is to have a collection of verifiable and beatable records, showcasing some of the most impressive Aislings across Temuair!

(( If anyone has any ideas about how to discourage botting for these records, I'm all ears!! ))

# Legend Mark Records
Here's a collection of records related to an increasing number on an Aisling's legend. They should be verifiable by viewing the Aisling's legend.

(Tricky part: the private legend marks... Either need to exclude private marks, or think up some reliable verification method, hmmm...)

### Admitted Citizens
Malache currently has this record, at 217 admitted citizens. This is back from Deoch 61, and almost certainly out of date!

### Adorations
Ishikawa has a whopping 15 adorations of Danaan. Oh my Danaan! Maybe BioMagus can save us?!

### Arena Battles
Acesin has been in many many arena battles. 1621, in fact!

### Arena Victories
Acesin has also won a ton of arena battles. 938! Getting close to 1k!

![Acesin](/assets/img/records/arena-victories/arena-victories-938-acesin-deoch-201.png)

### Arena Victory Loss Rate
Which Aisling has the worst arena battle victory rate? Coming soon!

(Probably need a minimum number of battles for this one, to not get skewed by small sample sizes)

### Arena Victory Win Rate
Acesin has an impressive arena battle win rate! 938/1621, which is roughly 58%. Better than a coin flip!

![Acesin](/assets/img/records/arena-victories-win-rate/arena-victories-win-rate-938-1621-acesin-deoch-201.png)

### Attended Class
Acesin has attended class at Mileth College 23 times. That's nearly 24!

![Acesin](/assets/img/records/attended-class/attended-class-23-acesin.png)

### Avid Daydreamer
~~Glasken even has time to daydream during his hefty record setting. 23 times daydreamt!~~

Sounds like StarNite might be the new record holder, with 24 times daydreamt! (Coming soon: a screenshot!)
