This is just an early alpha side project focused on figuring out which Aisling holds various interesting records!

If you contact Protein, NaLyd, or Dylanlan about a record that you might own, they'll be happy to reward you with a bright, glowing prize!!

The hope is to have a collection of verifiable and beatable records, showcasing some of the most impressive Aislings across Temuair!

(( If anyone has any ideas about how to discourage botting for these records, I'm all ears!! ))

# Legend Mark Records
Here's a collection of records related to an increasing number on an Aisling's legend. They should be verifiable by viewing the Aisling's legend.

(Tricky part: the private legend marks... Either need to exclude private marks, or think up some reliable verification method, hmmm...)

### Mentors
Someone has mentored 260 Aislings! Wow!

![Unknown 260 mentored](/assets/img/records/mentored/mentored-260.png)

### Hubaes
(Coming soon!)

### Divorces
(Coming soon!)

### Scars
NaLyd definitely has the most scars of any Aisling's legend, yup! A whopping 131. How embarassing! xD

### Arrests
(Coming soon! Spoilers: it's Ishikawa, surprise!! Claimed to be 3151 [pending verification])

### Adorations
(Coming soon!)

### Hwarone Kills
Glasken showed a very high number of war murders! Wow, 28k!

### Blackstar Runs
(Coming soon!)

### Annual events??
(Coming soon!)

### Gem Polishing
Awarded to Mighty Archer Dylanlan, who as of Deoch 201, has been involved in 6100 extra gem polishes (beyond Gem Smith 10) since his birth in Deoch 51.

Surely no other Aisling has a higher count than this, right??

### Blade Smithing
Awarded to Mighty Archer Dylanlan, who as of Deoch 201, has been involved in 201 extra blade smiths (beyond Blade Smith 10) since his birth in Deoch 51.

Surely no other Aisling has a higher count than this, right??

### Tailoring
Wizardrian has somehow acquired a Tailor (15) mark! (On some Aisling, unsure which!). There have also been rumours of a Tailor (19) somewhere, crazy!

![Wizadrian Tailor](/assets/img/records/tailor/tailor-15-wizadrian-deoch-201.png)


Vamistle also had Tailor (13) all the way back in Deoch 20. Impressive!

### Wizardry Research?
(Coming soon!)

### Herbalism?
(Coming soon!)

### Terror of the Crypt
Glasken again showed a very high number of terrors slain! 50, holy smokes!

![Glasken terrors](/assets/img/records/crypt-terror/glasken-50-jan-21-2024.png)

### Avid Daydreamer

~~Glasken even has time to daydream during his hefty record setting. 23 times daydreamt!~~

Sounds like StarNite might be the new record holder, with 24 times daydreamt! (Coming soon: a screenshot!)

### Daily Quests??
(Coming soon! One for each quest might be overkill, but whatevs)

### Arena Wins?
(Coming soon!)

### Arena Win ratio??
(Comin soon! Maybe exclude people with 0 losses, to prevent one-and-done attempts?)

### Number of Legend Marks
(Whoa, meta!! Coming soon!)

# Most Banked Light Belts
This award goes to the Aisling who currently owns the most Light Belt items in their bank account.

It is currently awarded to the Mighty Warrior Protein, who as of Deoch 201, has banked over 3,00 Light Belts since his birth in Deoch 108. That's more than 3 Light Belt per Deoch!! Incredible!!

Surely no other Aisling has a higher count than this?

# Interesting Legend Marks

A collection of interesting legend marks, but not necessarily "beatable"

Or maybe we should create a category on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/) for Darkages??

### Blackstar

Smallest group: ???
