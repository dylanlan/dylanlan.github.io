Deadline to request for this week: Sunday, February 18th around 8pm MT

#### Rules

I will post a weekly collection of Aisling names that anyone can claim, free of charge. No strings attached, and the rules are simple, I swear!

If you're interested in a name, just tell me:

1. Which (1) Aisling name you want this week.
2. How I should contact you (eg: Discord ID, email address, or in-game DA character to mail).

You can contact me by direct message to Discord ID `dylanlan2`, or by sending an in-game mail to `Dylanlan` or `NaLyd`.

Note that the Aisling gender is (M) for male, and (F) for female.

#### Winners

At the end of the weekend (likely Sunday night), each requested name will be claimed as follows:

- If a name was only requested by one person, then they win that name!
- If a name had multiple people interested, then I will [randomly](https://wheelofnames.com) pick who wins the name!
- If a name had zero interest, it will roll over into the next week.
- After 3 weeks, an unclaimed name will change to a first-come-first-served system, rather than waiting & randomly picking.

Winners of each name will be sent the Aisling's password (via requested contact method).

Make sure to change the password if you don't want me stealing the Aisling back at some point!!

#### More Rules...

- Only request a single name per week, please
- Please only request a name if you have actual plans to use it, at some point. I want to discourage excessive hoarding without using, like I've done :(
- If a name goes unclaimed for more than 3 weeks in a row, it will get archived to an "uninteresting" list.

Note: most lottery Aislings will have been born around the 108th deoch (which was after the last name purge happened), and will still be a level 1 peasant.

Have fun, and may the odds be ever in your favour, fellow Aislings!
