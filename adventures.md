This is an ongoing list of adventures that the Darkages Aisling Protein, and fellow Sradagan guild members, have courageously conquered.

## Lynith Sea


Our very first quest together began at Lynith Beach. We had heard rumours of there being some buried treasure under the sea, but we didn't have any idea how to find it! Someone had told us that the nearby Pirate Ship might have some clues, however.

We climbed aboard the nearby Pirate Ship, donning a piece of clever disguise. Thankfully the crew had zero suspicions! We found our way to the Captain's quarters, and stumbled upon an intriguing map. It mentioned following some enigmatic clues underwater. But unfortunately, we were not fish-Aislings, we were merely regular-Aislings!

Being unable to breathe underwater, we had to enlist some outside help. A very kind Aisling named Wizadrian let us borrow his mystical jewelry, which allows an Aisling to breathe underwater - perfect! We ventured into Lynith Sea, confident in our abilities. However, disaster struck when we got surrounded by a gang of territorial Octopus and Starfish, who apparently wished for us to visit Sgrios! Unfortunately, our wizard got beat up quite badly, and we had to make a daring rescue. But thankfully we all survived to tell this wild tale.

We eventually made our way to the end of the clues, which led us to a pair of shovels in the sand. Lo and behold, a mysterious Oren Key was buried underneath! Some questions answered, but even more questions were created. The quest continues!

## Oren Sewers

We discovered that the secret treasure Oren Key granted access to the sewers underneath Oren City. Why would access to sewers be considered treasure, one might ask? We certainly had no idea! But adventure awaits none the less! It was such an exciting quest, in fact, that _some_ of us forgot to cement our Aisling memories for future reflection - too caught up in the excitement of the moment. Oh well!

We found a few vicious salamanders, which gave us mighty trouble. We discovered that their defensive element was Darkness, but we lacked any strong Light-based attacks. Regardless, we powered through with our elemental disadvantage, like the courageous Aislings that we are. After a grueling 16 minutes of straight assail, the salamander finally teetered, and fell over.

Success! However, we quickly learned that each of us must kill two of those wretched beasts, to be able to venture further into the sewers. With five of us rag-tag Aislings, we were going to need 10 of these painful conquests, and our enthusiasm slightly wavered.

Fear not, young Aislings! We were fortunate to have some helpful siblings assist us with the murders. Through the power of poison and some ever-so-sneaky rogue traps, we were all able to acquire our required kill counts, and reached the end of the sewers.

What's this? Just a dinky fountain amidst a filthy, monster-laden sewer? Our disappointment was building - surely this epic quest was not so anti-climactic? We took a quick drink from the fountain, parched from the furious battles. Gasp! This was no ordinary fountain, and this was no ordinary water. Vitality! One by one, each of our health and mana levels were permanently increased! A glorious day indeed!

## Cthonic Remains Floor 10

Emboldened by our string of sucesses, we decided to venture into a very cursed and macabre area. Rumours had been spreading about some powerful monsters deep below some decrepit houses, which could yield many tasty experience points for our journey to acquire more insight. Some had even mentioned sightings of ancient mummies, walking the earth once again. Just a rural legend, or an actual fact? We were determined to find out!

Our journey began at House Macabre, near the Tagor Village. We tried to coordinate an epic group war-charge, but there were some challenges. One member of our group had somehow been turned into a Frog (were there witches in the area? unclear).
![Cthonic Remains 10 Start](/public/images/sradagan/sradagan-cr10-start.png)

After investigating a few houses, we located the entrance to a terrifying area that we dubbed, Cthonic Remains. There seemed to be never-ending stairs, and every level deeper increased our dread a little bit more. On our 6th floor deep, we finally confirmed that the rumours were true.

A mummy! Walking as if alive! The foul beast quickly attacked our vulnerable wizard, and we had to quickly counter-attack. Thankfully its defensive element was not Darkness, so it ended up being a much easier conquest than the Sewer Salamanders. It was still a fierce battle, but indeed, it granted a generous amount of experience!
![Cthonic Remains 10 Mummy Kill](/public/images/sradagan/sradagan-cr10-first-mummy.png)

The rush of killing our first mummy perhaps contributed to a bit of over confidence on Protein's part. We had beaten one mummy. Surely we could beat two at the same time, right?? Alas, it was too much for poor Protein to handle, and he promptly began the skulling ritual on his way to visit Sgrios. Thankfully his amazing group members were nearby to revive him. Sgrios would have to wait, for now..
![Cthonic Remains 10 Overconfident](/public/images/protein/protein-overconfident.png)

Protein was very excited to acquire the 71st insight, for it was an important milestone! At that point, one could wear newer, stronger armor, which would surely help in these life-or-death fights. As well as an excessively epic sword that was so mighty, it would require both Aisling hands just to contain it!

Protein was keeping a close eye on his experience points, anticipating the exact moment that he would reach 71, and be congratulated by his fellow hunting partners for an amazing accomplishment. However, the Cthonic Remains would not be so generous, and instead Protein was put to sleep by a wicked Suain spell, which consumed the exciting celebration of increased insight. Better luck next time, Protein...
![Cthonic Remains 10 Level 71](/public/images/protein/protein-level-71.png)

Unfortunately, Protein was barely not strong enough to wield both his new, epic sword, and all of his previous gear, so he had to make a tough choice. Look cool? Or be safe? He immediately chose to look cool, and even show of his skills of paralyzing a mummy that was behind himself.

Protein also enjoyed the thrill of using a skill named Crasher. It is quite an intimidating skill to use - it can only succeed if your health points are beneath a very low threshold. And using it successfully will leave you with but a single health point remaining. That's right. One health point away from death. None the less, it looks very cool, so Protein attempted it many times. I will not comment on his success rate, but here is one memory of an epic success:
![Cthonic Remains 10 Crasher](/public/images/protein/protein-crasher.png)

After a grueling few hours of hunting mummies, beetles, skeleton dogs, and spooky ghosts, we decided to call it quits, and take a break. Enough experience acquired for one day. More adventures await, tomorrow! However, Protein had to make one final attempt to look very cool, wielding his obnoxious sword.
