Curious how to play this mysterious game? Worry not! Here is a handy guide to help you get started.

# Playing

If you just want to play for free, you can download the game right now, and get started! It's easiest to play on Windows, but also possible to play on Linux using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/). I'm unsure about Macs!

If you've already created a character, but you're not sure what to do next, check out this guide: [Entering Temuair]({{ site.data.urls.enter_temuair }})

You can find an old Darkages Manual from 1999 [here]({{ site.data.urls.old_da_manual }})

You can install Darkages and create a new character in just 7 simple steps! (lucky!)

## Steps

1. Go to [https://www.darkages.com](https://www.darkages.com), and click on "Downloads", and accept the Terms of Service (ToS). It might be worth skimming the "Prohibited Conduct" section!

2. Click the "Single easy-install 7.41", and install it!
![Darkages Installer](/assets/img/darkages/installer.png){: width="100%" }

3. Follow the installation instructions! It might end up installing somewhere like `C:\Program Files (x86)\KRU\Dark Ages` by default. This can be fine, but it _might_ be recommended to install in a different location, or at least somewhere that you can "Run as Administrator", which unlocks some additional features in-game <TODO: add a screenshot of installer>

4. Double click the "Darkages.exe" file, and it should open an amazing login screen! (Please disregard the copyright year, it is not important)
![Darkages Login](/assets/img/darkages/login-screen.png){: width="100%" }

5. Try creating a character! A lot of good names might already be used, but you can still find good ones if you try hard enough!
![Darkages Create ](/assets/img/darkages/create-character.png){: width="100%" }

    If you receive a popup like "That name already exists or contains a reserved string", then that name might already be used (or contains a naughty word)
    ![Darkages Name Exists](/assets/img/darkages/name-in-use.png){: width="100%" }

    You might also receive a popup for an invalid name. Names can only be max of 12 letters long, cannot use numbers / special characters, and cannot contain certain acronyms (eg: `lol`)
    ![Darkages Name Invalid](/assets/img/darkages/invalid-name.png){: width="100%" }

    If you successfully create a character, it should take you back to the main login screen, and show you a popup saying "Character has been created."
    ![Darkages Character Created](/assets/img/darkages/character-created.png){: width="100%" }

6. Log in! You can just click the "Continue" button, and enter your new name and password (hopefully secure!)
![Darkages Begin](/assets/img/darkages/continue-character.png){: width="100%" }

7. Welcome to Temuair! If everything worked as expected, then you should now be in the tutorial area!

## Linux

For Linux, there has been some success using [Lutris](https://lutris.net/downloads).

You can install using the "Install a Windows game from an executable" option
![Lutris Install](/assets/img/darkages/install-with-lutris.png)

You also might need to point it to the proper `Darkages.exe` executable, if it opens the screen size selector instead.

# Registering
