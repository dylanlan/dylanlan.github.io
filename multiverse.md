## Zolian

Zolian is a server based on Dungeons & Dragons, Final Fantasy, Diablo 3, Zelda, Elder Scrolls, World of Warcraft and many other MMORPGs.

Many of the grind mechanics are from traditional Hack and Slashers that you know and love. Here you'll be able to build a character up and play either with friends or run solo. The main focus of Zolian is to balance the characters while breathing new life into Nexon's Darkages. That includes new music, new maps, classes, races, and pvp zones much like you would see in open world MMOs.

Current state: Beta
