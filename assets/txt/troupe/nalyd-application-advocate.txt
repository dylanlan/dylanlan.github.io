((

1. Website and software development. I have a blog I built in January, to track various fun things in Temuair: https://www.dylanlan.ninja

2. Video Editing. I am trying to learn how to edit videos, for entertainment or information purposes. 

Here are a couple examples:
- The Office in Temuair: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyiL-saaxE
- Pentagram Quest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGNNuCuwkhE

3. Screenshot Search / Analysis.

I have thousands of old screenshots from 2006-2010, which contain some interesting information. I'm wanting to create a searchable screenshot archive, eg: find a screenshot of BioMagus from 2008.
I've also been working on a few projects to track interesting legend marks, eg: https://www.dylanlan.ninja/records/

After discussing potential FoL trivia questions based on "Love" legend marks, I started compiling some famous Aisling legends, to help find interesting trivia / marks.

4. Hoarded sibling Aisling names that I created right after the last purge in (( 2012-ish )), which I'm trying to give back to the community. Maybe certain events could come with an Aisling name donated as a prize?
I have some names based on themes of: (( Temuair, Food, Pokemon, Verbs, IRL, Misc. ))

I have setup a lottery here, for giving away some names: (( https://www.dylanlan.ninja/name-lottery/ ))

))

* If appointed, what would be your first task as a Suomi Culture Advocate?

I'm already trying to figure out some potential FoL trivia questions based on famous Aisling legends. I will try to compile and submit a list this week.

Community Experience:

* Please list and briefly describe any current and/or previous noteworthy involvement you have (had) with other community aspects and institutions (sibling(s) included). This includes, but is not limited to participation in: Politics, Mileth College, Religious Temples, Guild leadership (leader or council positions,), and Arena hosting.

None until (( January 3, 2024 )). Since then, I've attended my first religious masses (Deoch and Sgrios), first Mileth College classes (Laurier 2x, Peppita 1x), helped form a new Sradagan guild (currently a Fellowship, and my friend Aon is the leader), and attended my first Arena battle a couple weeks ago (( To try and chat to "And" about the "Unbrickening" and Kru support tickets. I got wrecked though, haha )). But I'm trying to create a cool (( website )) for various nostalgia / excitement:
