<P>Dear Aisling,</P>
<P>Within every age there is a magical charm calling us back to a forgotten past. Out of the mystery of myth and legend arises a unique role-playing opportunity: to become part of the magical charm. Shed your mundane clothes; don the opportunity to imagine - to live - in Temuair's Dark Ages. </P>
<p><I>Dark Ages</I> has been everything I could hope for in an online roleplaying project: Features that reform the meaning of the genre, such as religions and politics that you can influence; wondrous details, such as flowers with magical properties, elemental nodes to be tapped, and faerie grounds. And the players: You, the Aisling (an "imaginative spirit"). Much more than an online roleplaying game, <I>Dark Ages </I>is a society in motion. You are about to make your entrance, your chrysalis, as a new Aisling. Discover the charm, the friendship, and the magic that the art of pretending can have in your life, within and without.</P>
