      <b>Learning skills</b><br>
      As you travel in Temuair, you will be able to learn skills from the mundanes in various
      towns.  If you travel to the different cities and visit the masters of the various
      classes (for instance, if you are a wizard, visiting Dar in Mileth), you will find that
      some will teach you new skills...for a price.      
      <br><br>
      <b>Using skills</b><br>
      If the skill affects an Aisling, you can use it in one of two ways:  by double             clicking on the skill icon, and then clicking on the Aisling you wish to cast it on; or             by dragging the skill icon onto the Aisling you wish to cast it on.<br><br>
      <b>Identifying items</b><br>
      Each class can learn an ability related to identifying items.  To use this skill, double               click on it.  The skill will identify the first item in your inventory (that is, the top             left<br><br>
      <b>Getting rid of a skill</b><br>
      If you ever desire to forget a skill you have learned, visit any master of the arts
      anywhere in Temuair (Dar, for example).  All of the masters will help you forget a skill
      that you no longer want knowledge of.
