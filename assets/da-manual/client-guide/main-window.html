  This window is the main interface for Dark Ages.  Its contents change with regards to the
  icons, but a brief discussion of its purpose is below.  
  <br><br>
  <b>Main Window</b><br><br>
  The main window's contents will change based on what icon you click.  There are five icons
  in all, and they are discussed in more detail in the next sections.
  <br><br>
  <b>Message Bar</b><br><br>
  Messages will appear in this bar.  Server messages, such as "Chaos is rising up" will 
  appear, as well as messages from other Aislings.  In addition, when you enter the game,
  the time of date will appear here.
  <br><br>
  <b>Information / Typing Bar</b><br><br>
  When you are talking to other Aislings, what you type will appear here.  When you are looking
  at your inventory or spells, the identification will appear here as well.
