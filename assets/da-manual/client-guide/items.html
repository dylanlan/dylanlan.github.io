  <div class="text">
      By clicking on the inventory icon <img src="./jpegs/buttons/items.jpg" align="bottom"> you can look at what you are currenty carrying.  You can also drop,
      use, or give away items.  When you click on the inventory icon, the main window will
      display items currenty in your inventory:
      <br><br><br>
      <center><img src="./jpegs/inventory.jpg"></center><br><br>
      <b>Picking up and dropping items</b><br>
      To pick an item up off the ground, double click it.  It will then appear in your
      inventory.  If you click and drag an item from your inventory to the scene window, or
      onto another Aisling, you will drop or give the item away.
      <br><br>
      <b>Identifying items</b><br>
      If you move your cursor over an item in your inventory, its name will appear in the
      information bar underneath the item window.  If the description is not very informative,
      you might try to identify the item, which is a skill that many of the classes possess.
      <br><br>
      <b>Dropping or giving away gold</b><br>
      If you click and drag the pile of gold into the scene window or onto another Aisling,
      a window will pop up asking how much gold you want to give away.
      <br><br>
      <b>Using or equipping items</b><br>
      If the item is a consumable such as wine or a blue potion, double clicking on it will
      allow you to use the item.  If the item is equipment in the form of a necklace, armor
      or a weapon, double clicking the item will allow you to equip it.  If you cannot equip
      it, the reason will be displayed in the message bar.  Equipping and removing items is
      discussed in more detail <a href="misc.html">in the Miscellaneous section</a>.
