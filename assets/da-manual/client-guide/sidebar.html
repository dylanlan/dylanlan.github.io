        The sidebar is the home of the picture window.  You can upload a portrait that will be
		displayed in the picture window to other Aislings.  To learn more, <a href="../../portrait.html">click here</a>.
		To see other Aislings' pictures, click on them; the picture will be 
		displayed in the picture box.  Underneath that is your name, in case you forgot, and a
		sun dial, which keeps track of night and day in Temuair.

		<b>Quick Tips on Pictures</b><br>
		Pick a picture that is appropriate to your character.  Your graphics should be "in-character",
		meaning that pictures from other games, etc, are inappropriate.  Pick something that represents
		who <i>you</i> are, and something that you feel comfortable representing you.<br>
