		  <b>The Legend</b><br><br>
		  Clicking on the "book icon" will reveal an Aisling's <i>legend</i>.  This is a record
		  of their achievements, trials, and tribulations as they progress through Temuair.
		  Text in white are ordinary events; text in blue are legendary events; and text in 
		  orange represents trials (trying to become a Demagogue) or horrible events (annoyances
		  or Sgrios's Scars).  You can learn a lot about an Aisling by reading their legend.
		  Do they mentor often?  Are they well known for their works?  The legend is a synopsis
		  of the character.
