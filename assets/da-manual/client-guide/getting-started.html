   Let's begin by taking a look at the DA startup options:

   <b>Create</b> - Allows you to create a new Dark Ages character.  You will
   be presented with <a href="./jpegs/new-char.jpg" target=_new>this screen</a>.  When creating 
   a new character, you can change his or her hair style or color, and enter in "Phrase Macros" - common sayings that you want
   to have handy (they can be said by pressing a combination of keys to be
   discussed later).  NOTE:  In order to be able to play Dark Ages with your
   new character, you must register your character.  To do this, visit 
   <a href="http://www.darkages.com">the Dark Ages website</a> and click on "Register".
   <br><br>
   <b>Continue</b> - This will allow you to enter Dark Ages as the character
   you specify.  If you get a message that says "Invalid password", you should
   check to make sure you are entering it correctly.  Dark Ages passwords are not
   case sensitive, but make sure you are typing it in exactly.  Sometimes, if
   you suddenly stop playing DA due to a disconnect or other trouble, it will
   say your character is in use, or display "Try again".  Wait a couple of
   minutes and you will be able to login.
   <br><br>
   <b>Password</b> - This will allow you to change your password.  Be sure not
   to forget it!  Don't pick something obvious, or a simple password - try to
   mix upper and lowercase letters, as well as numbers.  And never, never give
   your password out to ANYONE - even people you trust.  Nexon will never ask
   you for it.  Don't become a victim.<br><br>
   <b>Story</b> - Interested in the legend and story of Dark Ages?  This 
   option will allow you to read the story behind Dark Ages.  I suggest that
   you try to read it at least once.
   <br><br>
   <b>Credits</b> - This will display the people involved behind the scenes,
   making Dark Ages possible.<br><br>
   <b>Exit</b> - This will exit the client.<br><br>
