  <div class="text">
      By clicking on the talk icon <img src="./jpegs/buttons/talk.jpg" align="bottom"> you 
	  can see messages to and from other Aislings.   The main window will 
	  show conversations going on arond you as well as incoming "whispers" (in blue).
      <br><br><br>
      <center><img src="./jpegs/talk-window2.jpg"></center><br><br>
      <b>Taking part in conversations</b><br>
      At any time, you can press ' (the quote key) and say something.  What you say will 
	  appear as a text bubble in the scene window.  Other Aislings that are nearby will hear 
	  you.  To "yell" and let all Aislings in the area know what you are saying, press !, which 
	  will allow you to "shout".
	  <br><br>
      <b>Interacting with other Aislings ("Whisper")</b><br>
	  [Note: Put Message-sending bar image here]<br><Br>
      If you press " (shift-quote key), you will see To-? in your information bar.  Enter the 
	  name of the Aisling you wish to speak to, followed by the enter key, then type your 
	  message and press enter.  Your message will be sent to the other Aisling.  Sometimes, you
	  will get a message back: "This person cannot hear you".  This will occur if you have 
	  whisper turned off, or if the other person has their whisper turned off, or you are on
	  their ignore list (discussed below)  When other Aislings send you messages,
	  they will appear in the message bar.  If you have your communication window open, they
	  will appear in blue, like in the above image.  When you send a message, it is displayed 
	  as [yourname]" [message], like in the above example (Kedian sent a message to himself).
	  Similarly, when you recieve a message, it is displayed as [yourname]> [message].
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Group and motley messaging</b><br>
      If you are a member of a group or a motley, special messaging options are available to
	  you.  If you are a member of a group and send a message (press shift-quote) to <b>!!</b>, 
	  your message will be sent to all the members of your group.  This is helpful when you want 
	  to say "Help, I'm going to die" or "My, isn't that Ogre Captain angry, and what a big club
	  he has!".  Motley chat is similar; send a message to <b>!</b> and your message will be sent
	  to all motley members.  This can be easily abused, so check with your motley leader
	  for his or her policies on chat.  Some might allow chatter, whereas others only allow
	  emergency messages.  Guild messages will appear in a pink color on your talk window;
	  group messages, in a forest green.
	  <br><br>
	  <b>Quieting the chatter</b><br>
      Sometimes, when you are hunting, or are very busy, you may wish to turn whisper off.
	  To do this, press F4.  You can turn both motley chat and regular whispers off.
	  Remember that you cannot send messages to other Aislings while your whisper is off.<br><br>
      <b>The ignore list</b><br>
	  You may find that another Aisling just won't stop bothering you.  If you are in this situation,
	  you can add the troublemaker to your "ignore" list.  Press F9, and you'll see a prompt in
	  the window beneath the chat window that says (a)dd, (d)elete?  From here, you can either add (press a)
	  or delete (press d) Aislings to your ignore list.  When someone is on your ignore list, you won't
	  recieve any of their whispers, and will not be able to whisper to them.
