        on your friends list will appear in green, fellow guild members in blue.  You can click
        on the different tabs (Rogue, Master, etc) to narrow down the list to all Rogues 
        online, all Wizards online, and so on.  "Master" is reserved for a special group of
        powerful Aislings, who have reached level 99.  The list is sorted by level, so in this
        example, Faeron is the highest level player online, and Nehynuci is the lowest level.
