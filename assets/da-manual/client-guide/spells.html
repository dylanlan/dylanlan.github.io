      By clicking on the spells icon <img src="./jpegs/buttons/spells.jpg"                     align="bottom"> you can see what skills you have learned.  You can also use these skills
      on items or other Aislings.  The main window will change to show you the skills currently
      available to you.

      <b>Learning spells</b><br>
      To learn spells, visit your local master.  Wizards, for instance, can visit the wizard
      masters in different cities (Dar in Mileth, for example) to learn various elemental 
      spells, whereas priests can visit Bertil to learn the healing arts.<br><br>
      <b>Using spells</b><br>
      If the spell affects an Aisling, you can use it in one of two ways:  by double     
      clicking on the spell icon, and then clicking on the Aisling you wish to cast it on; or                                     by dragging the spell icon onto the Aisling you wish to cast it on.  You can cast combat                     spells on monsters in the same manner.  Take note that you cannot cast offensive spells                   while in any neutral area (towns and entrances to monster lairs)<br><br>
      <b>Spell macros</b><br>
      Another way to cast spells is to assign a specific spell to a macro key...blah<br><br>
      <b>Getting rid of a spell</b><br>
      If you ever desire to forget a spel you have learned, visit any master of the arts
      anywhere in Temuair (Dar, for example).  All of the masters will help you forget a spell
      that you no longer want knowledge of.
      <br><br>
      <b>The art of combat</b><br>
      If you're a wizard, this is rather important.  Practice makes perfect.  You might
      remembe this:  NEVER ADVENTURE ALONE.  Number one, it's not fun, and number two,
      it's becoming increasingly hazardous.  Sgrios (the god of death) isn't a 
      very good conversational partner...
