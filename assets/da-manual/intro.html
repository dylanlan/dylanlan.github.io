    <i>Greetings, Aisling *smiles*</i><br><br>
	Welcome to the Dark Ages manual.  This manual is intended to help you get started, and
	provide a general knowledge base for Dark Ages players.  You will find guides to Temuarian
	legends, history, and a guide on using the DA interface here.
	<br><br>
	This manual was assembled by Mide Province,
	from a multitude of sources.  Content submitted by players, Nexon web pages, and Mide Province's original
	works were used in the production of this manual.<br><br>
	If you would like to send feedback, <a href=http://www.darkages.com/contact>please do so</a>.
	<br><br>
	That having been said, welcome to Temuair.  We hope you'll enjoy it as much as we do.
