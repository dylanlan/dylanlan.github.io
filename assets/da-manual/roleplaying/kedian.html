	a character.</b></a></a>
<p>
	This is perhaps the most important issue.  You are an Aisling,
	we all know that...but what of it?  Are you a warrior from a 
	far away land?  Were you born the son of a mundane, or does 
	your lineage descend from ancient wizards and skilled rogues?
	<p>
	The best way to develop your character is to let your
	imagination go.  Sit back and think about the age you are in;
	the time period that you play in.  If you feel it would help,
	research the time period.  Read about the mythological and 
	religious beliefs of the time.  Try to understand more about
	the world your character exists in.  It will make it easier
	to develop a believable story.
	<p>
	Your story can be as long or as short as you want.  You will
	find that over time, as you play and learn more about the world
	of your character, you will naturally begin to add to your 
	character's history and his "persona".  Is your character a
	brooding, fearsome warrior, or is he a caring, delicate priest?
	Your character's persona will most likely mirror your own 
	personality, with exceptions.  You might want your character
	to be a complete opposite of your personality; it's up to you.
	<p>
	If you're getting frustrated - remember to relax.  No one is
	forcing you, and there is no pressure.  With time, you will
	weave your character's persona and history with ease.  Take
	it one step at a time.  Where did your character come from?
	Who were his parents?  What was his childhood like?  These 
	are perhaps the most important aspects of your character.
	Once you've established this, you can fill in details - stories
	of your character's trials and tribulations; how he/she dealt
	with their new power as an Aisling; your first battle with
	the seemingly indefatigable rat....Your imagination will take
	over and create the different aspects of your character.
	<p>
	There are those who may believe that they are not creative, or
	imaginative, by nature.  I believe that everyone has an 
	imagination, but that some of us are more adept at realizing
	and using it.  To some, character development will come easily;
	while for others, it will at first seem to be an agonizing 
	process.  For those of you who are having difficulty, the best
	way to spark your imagination is, as I have said, to read about
	the era we play in.  The more you learn about the world around
	you, the easier it will be to weave your character into
	existence.
	<p>
	Lastly - remember that you're here to have fun!  Take it easy,
	and slowly.  You don't have to sit down and write novels; 
	that's not the point.  The point is to create a character.
	Your character.  It doesn't have to happen overnight; there
	are no deadlines.  Allow yourself time to think and let your
	imagination do the work for you.
	<p>

<li><a name=character><a href=#top><b>Approach the <i>Dark Ages</i> world as your character would.</b></a></a>
<p>
	Remember that we are all Aislings, but that the power to look
	at the world around us and actually <i>notice</i> it - the power
	to take control - is new to us all.  Your character is new
	to the world around him; he is likely to be fascinated
	by things that would seem normal and mundane to us.  The whole
	world, for your character, has just come alive.  He is able
	to see and feel and hear with new clarity and feeling. 
<p>
	This becomes especially important when you are interacting with
	other people.  If your character continually ignores the world
	around him and focuses on bashing things with swords instead
	of taking note of the beauty around him, he will seem boring 	
	and <i>mundane.</i>  You are an Aisling because you can experience
	the world around you, in contrast with the mundane Merchants
	and NPC's.  Don't allow yourself to be an NPC!  It will bore
	other players who are more interested in the actual roleplaying
	than the mechanics of it.
	<p>

<li><a name=dialect><a href=#top><b>Speak in an appropriate "dialect".</b></a></a>
	<p>
	Contrary to popular belief, the entire world does not speak
	Standard English.  If you can, try to use Old English, or
	at the very least, adapt a stiff formality with your language.
	A good idea is to drop slang and contractions; your wizard
	isn't going to say "Yo dude, sup?" and get any kind of useful
	response from the characters around you.  Try to remember that
	the "reality" of the world around you - that is, its perceived
	"
	<p>
	It's important to remember the concept of being "in character".
	The strictness of roleplaying will vary from person to person.
	Some will be in character all the time, whereas some will
	loosen the rules for friends who are in the game with them.
	Some will even be in character when you send them private 
	messages, and will expect the same from you.  Like I said,
	it differs from person to person.  A good rule of thumb is,
	you can never be too formal, and you can never be too polite.
	<p>
	Also, do you speak another language?  It might be entertaining
	to make up words and claim them as part of an ancient
family language (which, conveniently, no one else speaks).
	"Frizan frabzorb!! Melthlar queue?"  This can also be 
	incredibly annoying to those around you if you do it all the
	time (people don't like others who constantly speak in tongues)
	so do it sparingly (for instance, in place of normal interjections
(expressions of fright, shock, pain, etc.) )
	<p>
	Another thing to consider is how you refer to out-of-character
	(OOC) events and descriptions.  A good thing to remember is
	to enclose anything that you want to say OOC with double 
parentheses; i.e. ((I have to go, it's nearly 2:00am here)).  
	For instance; you're not logging off, you're "heading to the
	inn for a good rest".  You didn't get "kicked off", you were
	"mysteriously possessed by the infamous lag beast".
	<p>
<li><a name=imagine><a href=#top><b>Be descriptive, imaginative, and creative.</b></a></a>
	<p>
	Always remember that you are an Aisling, and can see the world
	around you for what it is.  When you describe things, whether it
	be in a conversation to another character or a story you are
	writing, be imaginative.
	<p>
	For example.  "The sky was blue.  It was cold outside."
	<p>
	A better way to say this would be "The sky was a brilliant blue,
	much like the ocean at Abel.  A bitter wind rushed through
	the landscape, chilling me to the bone."
	<p>
	Try to be as descriptive as possible when you talk to other 
	players, especially if you are trying to tell them how to find
	something.  "It's right over there" doesn't exactly cut it.
	A better way to say it would be "Go over the bridge, take a right
	at the blacksmith's, and keep going until you see the river."
	<p>
	Part of the fun of roleplaying is immersing yourself in the 
	virtual world around you.  You want that world to be as real 
	as possible; your creativity and imagination will aid in making
	it seem "real" (and it will prevent those around you from thinking
	you're a boring mundane).
	<p>
<li><a name=talk><a href=#top><b>Tips for reacting and talking with other players.</b></a></a>
	<p>
	You will meet a wide variety of people in Dark Ages, from a 
	diffuse cross-section of backgrounds.  It's important to remember
	that everyone will react to situations differently.
	<p>
	For instance, different people take offense to different types
	of discussions and material.  It's important to know other 
	people's boundaries and not cross them willingly.
	<p>
 Also, as I have mentioned earlier, there is a difference in how
	people roleplay.  Some people will stay in character constantly,
	speak (okay, well, "type") in a Gaelic accent, and never mention
	anything outside of Dark Ages.  It's important to respect those
	people and not break the illusion for them (for instance, if
	someone is being formal and polite to you, return the favor).
	<p>
	Always approach people with an open mind.  Greet them, and get
	to know them.  You will make many friends in the game, and will
	adventure and journey with them.  To me, this is the most rewarding
	part of the game.  
	<p>
	Above all, remember to be courteous, and polite.  If you treat
	people with disrespect, they will do the same; and you will 
	acquire a reputation of being non-sociable.  Try to remember that
	there is a human being on the other end of the character you're
	interacting with, and they react to what you say.  The golden
	rule "Think before you speak" certainly applies here.
	<p>
	The most important thing, however, is to remember that this 
	is a game, and we are here to have fun and be entertained.  If
	someone takes offense, apologize.  You gain nothing by stubbornness
	and false pride.  Don't be afraid to admit you're wrong or that
	you made a mistake.
	<p>
<li><a name=boundary><a href=#top><b>Know your boundaries and the line between fantasy and reality.</b></a></a>
	<p>
	Spoken from experience, there are those who get very involved
	in the fantasy of the game.  And some may forget that it is
	just a game.
	<p>
	For example, in some RPGs, you
	can get married.  Getting married (at least to this roleplayer)
	is a serious thing.  However, remember that being married in the
	roleplaying world does not necessarily relate or impart any relationship
	outside of the game.  While this may <i>seem</i> like a silly, 
	obvious issue, it is not.  I have met many players 
  who confuse the line between fantasy and reality
	and often create problems for everyone involved by doing so.
	Many people who get married then ask for their "husband" or 
	"wife's" phone number, address, etc.  While your relationship
	with your "spouse" may eventually lead to a real life one, it is
	inappropriate to assume that it will, or force it to.  
		<p>
	Also, remember that the mood you are in will undoubtedly come out
	in your character's thoughts and actions.  If you are angry, 
upset, depressed, etc. - your character will seem to be these
	things.  Try to play the game with an open mind, and don't use
	it as an escape.  The game should be recreation, entertainment, and
	<i>fun.</i>  It is not recommended to use the game as an escape from
	the world around you.  Some people do this, and eventually it leads
	to being unable to deal with the real world around you.  It's 
	important to remember that the game is just a game, and while it
	is appropriate to roleplay and enjoy the game to its fullest, it
	is detrimental to use the game to replace real life.
	<p>
	Again, this may not apply to you, and you may never have this 
	problem.  But, from my experience, there are those to whom this
	does apply, and it is my hope that maybe by writing this, just one
	person will think twice about what roleplaying really means.
