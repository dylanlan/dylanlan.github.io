<P>None resemble Renaissance England. English terms like "thee" and "thou" are good for several role-playing fantasy worlds, but for Temuair, it doesn't fit. Certainly, anyone who is using English terms is role-playing, and deserves applause for it. However, it's not the tongue of Temuair or the tuatha that populate it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h1><P>How, then, should one speak?</P></h1>
<P>At a minimum</P>
<br>
<P>An Aisling of Temuair can use all the same words as before, without slipping in "thee" and "thou". The mundanes of Temuair offer samples of speech that is common to Temuair. You can speak modern non-slang. If you're talking about things in Temuair, then you're in-character. Great.</P>
<P>Encourage anyone who is putting an effort into being in-character, even if it is not accurate. Hyper-criticism and elitism are as destructive as heckling is to the role-playing environment.</P>

<LI>Research the inspiring works. All the inspiring literature lists dialogue that fits into Temuair in one way or another. The Shakespearian dialogue should be referred to for it's poetic rhythm and imagery, not the King James English "thees" and "thous".</LI>
<LI>Consider your character's background. Pick your favorite literature from one of the real Earth places listed above ('France' if your character grew up in Loures, and so on). </LI>
<LI>Research a little into acting and character dialogue in general. There is a treasure of literary style and drama style advice. Plays are a great way to read dialogue.</LI></OL>
