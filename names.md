### Aisling Name Giveaway!

Hello there! Are you wanting to play Darkages, but can't come up with a good name for your Aisling? If so, then step right up!

##### Current Names Available

First come first served, to get these Aisling names!

#### Rules

I will periodically post some Aisling names that I'm giving away. If you want a name, just tell me which one! You can contact me by direct message to Discord ID `dylanlan2`, or by sending an in-game mail to `Dylanlan` or `NaLyd`.

Note:
- The Aisling's current gender is (M) for male, and (F) for female.
- I will send you the Aisling's password, and you should change it if you want to keep the Aisling.
- Requesting more than 1 name per week is discouraged
- Please only request a name if you have actual plans to use it, at some point. I want to discourage excessive hoarding without using, like I've done `:(`
- Most of these Aislings will have been born around the 108th deoch (which was after the last name purge happened), and will still be a level 1 peasant
