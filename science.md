Hello there, fellow Aisling! Are you wanting to help with Temuair Science? Then you're in luck!

Here are a list of unknown scenarios / hypotheses. If you can test them out, take screenshots or video, and confirm what happens, then scientists all over Temuair will be very grateful!


## Repairing Master Gear

It's possible to re-craft your master or grand master gear if it happens to break - this is well known.

But what are the triggers to allow you to re-craft? Are there any scenarios where you can end up with two copies of your master/grandmaster armor pieces or weapon??

To try out:
- Use a gender swap so that you cannot wear your current master gear. Check if the re-craft option exists for you?
- Bank your master gear?
- Parcel your master gear to yourself?
- Drop your master gear on a beggar?
- Get your master gear bashed to 0 durability?




## What else?
