Here's an attempt at briefly explaining why this website exists, and what it's all about!

#### History

[Darkages](https://www.darkages.com/) is an old [MMORPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) computer game, first released in 1999.

It was quite popular in the 2000s, but has had a dwindling community since then. I, myself, have very fond memories of the game, mostly from 2005-2010. This website is an attempt to re-ignite interest in the game, and see if the developers of the game can work on features and bugfixes faster than they have in the past decade or two.


#### Sradagan

The Sradagan guild is a group of players in the game, who want to re-experience some of the great moments of the game that are often overlooked nowadays.

#### Religion

The game has a unique in-game religion system, where "Mass sermons" are held by players themselves. There are at least 8 different deities to worship, each with their own values and beliefs.

- [Deoch Mass]({{ site.data.urls.deoch_mass }})

#### College & Art

The game has an interesting in-game college system, where players can give "Lectures" about various in-game topics. There is also an Art/Lore Contest system, which encourages creative writing, art, music, or other mediums, to help keep the game world a vibrant and interesting place

#### Quests & Hunting

The game has over 60 quests in the "early-game" (before becoming a Master), and even more quests in "end-game" (Master and Medenia area). It also has various areas to hunt vicious monsters.
