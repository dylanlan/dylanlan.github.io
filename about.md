Here's an attempt at briefly explaining this fan site that you're currently looking at. It's for an old video game called [Darkages](https://www.darkages.com/).

If you want to play the game for free, check out the [Getting Started Guide]({{ site.data.urls.get_started }})

### Context

[Darkages](https://www.darkages.com/) is an old [MMORPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) computer game, first released in 1999.

It was quite popular in the 2000s, but has had a dwindling community since then. I, myself, have very fond memories of the game, mostly from 2005-2010. This website is an attempt to re-ignite interest in the game, and see if the developers of the game can work on new features and bugfixes faster than they have in the past decade or two, so that it can become an even more fun game.

[Definitions]({{ site.data.urls.definitions }}) can be helpful, if you're confused by some of the words in this site!

### Sradagan

The Sradagan guild is a group of players in the game, who want to re-experience some of the great moments of the game that are often overlooked nowadays.

### Religion

The game has a unique in-game religion system, where "Mass sermons" are held by players themselves. There are at least 8 different deities to worship, each with their own values and beliefs.

- [Sgrios Mass]({{ site.data.urls.sgrios_mass }})
- [Sgrios Forsaken]({{ site.data.urls.sgrios_forsook }})
- [Deoch Mass]({{ site.data.urls.deoch_mass }})
- (Coming soon: Glioca mass!)

If you want to hear some of my piano music inspired by some of the religions, you can find them here: [Temuair Piano Music]({{ site.data.urls.music }})

### College & Art

The game has an interesting in-game college system, where players can give "Lectures" about various in-game topics. There is also an Art/Lore Contest system, which encourages creative writing, art, music, or other mediums, to help keep the game world a vibrant and interesting place

### Quests & Hunting

The game has over 60 quests in the "early-game" (before becoming a Master), and even more quests in "end-game" (Master and Medenia area). It also has various areas to hunt vicious monsters.
