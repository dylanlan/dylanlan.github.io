- Context: a brief explanation of this website itself!
- Adventure Log: various new (2024+) in-game screenshots and narrations
- QoL: a collection of suggested improvements to the game
- Links: helpful links to other related websites
- Games: some silly games / projects that I want to work on
- Memories: a collection of old in-game screenshots, mostly from 2006-2010
