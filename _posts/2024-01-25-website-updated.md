Welcome to my personal fan website for Darkages! If you have no idea what is happening, then feel free to check out the [Context](({{ site.data.urls.context }})) page.

You can find some links at the top of the site, or in a 3-line "hamburger" menu:

- About: a brief introduction for myself
- Context: a brief explanation of this website itself!
- Get Started: a guide for joining this crazy game!
- Adventure Log: various new (2024+) in-game screenshots and narrations
- QoL: a collection of suggested improvements to the game
- Links: helpful links to other related websites
- Games: some silly games / projects that I want to work on
- Memories: a collection of old in-game screenshots, mostly from 2006-2010
