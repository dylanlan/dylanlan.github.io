The Suomi Troupe hosted an epic weekend of Pet related events!

# Pet Tamer's Lore

Laurier hosted an informative class where Aislings learned about the inspiration behind the pet festival. This kick-off event featured a lecture and class competition dedicated to Lady ReyaKeely's inspirational work on pet taming.

Here's a recording from the wonderful witch, Ulli!

# Temuair Pet Battles

Ulli hosted an epic tournament for pets to battle each other! This was a game of chance rather than a game of skill; victory was determined by the RNG of spells ‘missing’ the target pets.

How Temuair Pet Battles worked:

1. Entrants were placed into a tournament bracket.
2. The pets met in the middle of a dueling ring and faced each other.
3. The pet’s partners called out a single attack
4. Event Host Ulli chose a wizard ard spell that closest resembled the called-out attacks and casted it on the corresponding pet.
5. If the pet dodged the spell (displays the “MISS” animation above its head), the pet gained a point.
6. The first pet to dodge 3 spells won the battle!
7. If both pets reached 3 points in the same round, additional rounds will be held until one has more dodges than the other.
8. Winners continued onward in the tournament until there was one clear winner.

# Pet Race

Set hosted an intense tournament of pet races! Aislings commanded their pets through an obstacle course of coins to reach the goal the fastest. One mis-step onto a coin from their pet meant they had to restart from the beginning!

2. Best Matching without Mundane help: Use the clothing and accessories you have collected from the world ((kruna store forbidden)) to best match the look of your pet.
