Have you created a new character (Aisling) and want to start playing in the game world (Temuair), but not sure what to do?? Let's follow a mini-adventure of two brave Aislings, to find out some options!

Here's a video of what can be done next:

Or, you can follow along these screenshots, if you'd rather!

New Aislings will spawn in the tutorial area by default, which has a wealth of information about the game, and even some monsters to practice killing!

Feel free to talk to Raghnall if you want to learn how to fight

![Tutorial Combat](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/tutorial-combat.png){: width="100%" }

If you walk up a bit, Bartley has a bunch of information about the game!

![Tutorial Bartley](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/tutorial-bartley.png){: width="100%" }

If it's too much to read through and you just wanna start killing things, it's recommended to at least click through the Interface section. It will teach you a couple nifty skills/spells in your `h` pane. `Look` can tell you what item is on the ground in front of you, and `nis` can tell you the current time in-game.

The Tutorial is littered with weak Kardi monsters - feel free to practice your combat on them!

![Tutorial Kardi](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/tutorial-kardi.png){: width="100%" }

After you finish the Tutorial, you will find yourself back in Mileth Inn. But you will have received some experience, and likely gained a level or two!

You will acquire 2 stat points for every level. You can apply them in the `g` pane, where the flashing up-arrows are displayed.

Use caution, though! Stats can be a very limited resource. You might want to wait until you figure out which Class you want to be (more on that, later), before discovering that you wasted a stat point.

![Tutorial Experience](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/tutorial-exp.png){: width="100%" }

After finishing the tutorial, you will end up in the Mileth Village Inn

![Mileth Inn](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/mileth-inn.png){: width="100%" }

If you want to see the Chat Log, you can press `f`, or click the buttons to the right of the lower window.

There are panes for Inventory (`a`), Skills (`s`), Spells (`d`), Chat (`f`), Stats (`g`), and additional Skills/Spells (`h`). The buttons are located to the right of the window pane.

You can chat by pressing `Enter`, typing a message, and then press `Enter` again.

You can direct-message another player by "Whispering" to them, by pressing `Shift` + `"`, typing their name, pressing `Enter`, typing your message, and pressing `Enter` again. Note that to whisper, you need to either be at least level 11, or registered with a subscription.

If you ever get confused by which keys to use, there's a Hotkey reference that you can click - the `?` button in the bottom right of the screen.

![Hotkeys](/assets/img/darkages/hotkeys.png){: width="100%" }

If you want to leave the Mileth Inn - just walk with Arrow Keys (or right-click) towards the highlighted rug

![Crios Awakens](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/crios-awakens.png){: width="100%" }

If you left-click on yourself (or press `a` twice), you can see more details about your Aisling. Oh my! Looks like this Aisling is missing all their equipment!

![Aisling Profile](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/aisling-self.png){: width="100%" }

There are various buildings and Non-Player-Characters (NPCs, called Mundanes) in Mileth Village.

If you ever get lost, you can use the X and Y coordinates on the lower part of the screen, to figure out where you are and where you might want to be.

The Mileth Tavern is a good building to take note of - it often contains rumours of quests and adventures to be had! As well as some options to explore Mileth Politics. The Inn can be found at coordinates (71,54) in Mileth Village

Ok, that was a ton of pre-amble...

Where can you kill monsters?! Patience, young Aisling! If you're wanting an adventure, you can find a mysterious Crypt in Mileth Village, located at coordinates (93, 50)

![Crypt Entrance](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/mileth-crypt-entrance.png){: width="100%" }

But be careful! Once inside, you'll be greeted by many vicious beasts. Mice, spiders, centipedes?! Oh my!

![Crypt Monsters](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/mileth-crypt-monsters.png){: width="100%" }

If you slay foul monsters, you will gain experience points. Acquire enough, and you will grow another level - with even more stat points to learn!

![Crypt Level Up](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/mileth-crypt-level-up.png){: width="100%" }

But which stats should I learn?! Great question, random visitor - I'm glad you asked! Let's head to the Temple of Choosing, which you can find at coordinates (95, 13).

![Temple of Choosing](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/temple-of-choosing.png){: width="100%" }

Inside, `Aoife` can sell you some class tutorial books, which can give details about your decision to make.

The classes are similar to other RPG games - here's a quick tl;dr:

- Warrior: front-line attacker, wears sturdy armor and wields mighty swords to attack monsters face-to-face. Mostly needs Strength, with a bit of Constitution and Dexterity. Later becomes a Gladiator.
- Monk: front-line attacker, wields powerful fists and spells from nature to outwit foes. Needs a balance of stats, with a focus on Strength and Constitution. Later becomes a Druid.
- Rogue: a trickster class, able to set traps for damage/status effects, and skills to identify and control monsters. Needs a balance of stats, with a focus on Dexterity. Later becomes an Archer
- Priest: a critical support class, able to heal group members, and curse monsters to weaken their defenses. Needs a ton of Intelligence and Wisdom. Later becomes a Bard
- Wizard: a magical class, able to wield the powers of elements to enhance the group's damage output, or do damage themselves. Focuses on different stats, depending on element, but Intelligence and Wisdom are recommended. Later becomes a Summoner


Note that it's also possible to "sub-class", which means becoming a different class and keep all your skills and spells from your first class. For example, you can start off as a monk and learn many kicks and punches, then "sub" into warrior where you learn many sword slashing attacks, and then end up as a gladiator who knows kicks, punches, _and_ sword slashes.

If you want more information about classes, refer to [vorlof.com](https://www.vorlof.com/skills.html), which has information about every skill, spell, weapon, and armor in the game!

After you're confident in your decision, you can talk to `Aoife` again, and pick `Path Reception`.

![Aoife](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/toc-aoife.png){: width="100%" }

Stand in the centre to receive the next clue about where to find your class teacher. Physical attackers take the left door, and magic casters take the right door.

![Temple Circles](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/stand-in-centre.png){: width="100%" }

Once you've found the class that you want to become, simply talk to the NPC, and choose to become the class. You can become the class by yourself, but if you have a friend of the same class, then they can guide you.

![Become a Priest](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/become-priest.png){: width="100%" }

If you check your profile again, it should now show that your Class is no longer Peasant!

![Crios Priest](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/crios-priest.png){: width="100%" }

You can also check the skill tab, to see the list of skills and spells that you can learn. They will also show which stats you need, to learn them.

![Spell Stats](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/need-stats.png){: width="100%" }

If you can find Devlin in Mileth, she can teach quite a few spells (pick `Learn Secret`) to priests!

![Devlin](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/devlin.png){: width="100%" }

Beag ioc is a very important spell - it heals other Aislings!

![Beag Ioc](/assets/img/awakening/me/crios/learn-beag-ioc.png){: width="100%" }

You can test out your new spells in Mileth Crypt

Phew, that was a lot - you should take a break!

When you get back, feel free to check out one of the lower leveled quests available: [Terror of the Crypt]({{ site.data.urls.crypt_terror }})
