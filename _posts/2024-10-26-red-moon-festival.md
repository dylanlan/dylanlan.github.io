The Suomi Troupe hosted spooky weekend events to celebrate the Red Moon!


# Chaos Uprising

"Be forewarned, aislings: the Count and Countess of Macabre are engaged in more than their usual mischief. I sense an unnatural presence permeating the area--one all too familiar to the tormented villagers of Tagor. A coven of liches convene at the estate as I write... Extremely dangerous fiends, much like those encountered in the Balanced Arena.

I suspect the diabolical duo plans to ambush anyone who dares to trespass on their estate."

(( This event will commence at House Macabre Entrance on Friday, October 25 at 7:00pm PST ))

# The Pentagram Grimoire Vol. II: The Blood Moon◀▶

"And so it came to pass that the disciples of the possessed sorcerer manifested the ominous blood moon. Their meddling with forbidden magic led to their immolation at the hands of the zealots of Isghar Hamlet, just west of Tagor. The blood moon has since subsided, but not without consequence: its unsettling presence disturbed the spirits invoked through the gruesome Pentagram ritual at the sacred temple.

As I reflect on that tumultuous night, I can still feel the heart-stopping shrills and hair-raising chills, trapped inside the haunted studies we foolishly investigated. The doors locked behind us. Most of us escaped by the skin of our teeth with remarkable relics bestowed by the spirits. My pupil, however, lay lifeless on the cold floor claimed by the Unspeakable Horror.

Take heed: should the blood moon rise again, this ritual is not for the faint of heart. The spirits are forbidden from revealing their secrets, always veiling their messages in riddles and clues. If the ritual succeeds, you might claim the spirits’ coveted relics as your own; fail, and you must brace yourself for a far more sinister fate..."

It would appear the excerpts of a newly discovered volume connected to the Pentagram have been excavated from the rotting filth of House Macabre. Who will attempt this dangerous ritual before the Red Moon cycle concludes?

# Murder Mystery

A dark cloud has descended over Suomi. The quaint town's usually quiet paths now whisper with unease and suspicion as Temuairan law enforcement works to unravel the murder of one of their own. Can Aislings assist the Suomi Troupe and bring peace back to the town before the killer's trail grows cold?

(( This semi-interactive play will commence in Suomi Village on Saturday, October 26 at 6:00pm PST ))
