I accidentally broke my piano earlier this year, and I've been meaning to fix it for weeks. However I kept getting distracted by Temuair, so I decided to take a break to focus on fixing this beauty.


# Problem

Some of the keys were uneven, and weren't playing their sounds as expected

I had dealt with similar problems in the past, so figured I'd open it up, and take a look.

Ah. The metal hammer part had broken off from its plastic encasing, and couldn't properly hit the "thing-a-ma-jig", to complete a circuit and create sound (or something along those lines)

Many other keys were nearly broken, or very far along in the breaking process.

I know how to fix this!! Glueeeeeeeeeee!


# Fixing

I decided to turn my regular piano keys into "Reinforced Piano Keys", and had to remove them all, to do so.

It took longer than I had wanted, but I eventually removed them all!

I just used some cheap 5-minute epoxy, to glue the broken keys back together, or reinforce some nearly-broken keys

# Fixed

Did it work?! I sure hope so!!

Here's a playlist of Temuair Music that I hope to add to: [Temuair Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GWSxaos-ME&list=PL6LD2x2A2qLFEAd6xN69dE-YgEIrYOFZw)
