This is just an early alpha side project focused on figuring out which Aisling holds various interesting records!

If you contact Protein, NaLyd, or Dylanlan about a record that you might own, they'll be happy to reward you with a bright, glowing prize!!

The hope is to have a colletion of verifiable, and beatable records, showcasing some of the most impressive Aislings across Temuair!

(( If anyone has any ideas about how to discourage botting for these records, I'm all ears!! ))

# Legend Marks
Here's a collection of records related to an increasing number on an Aisling's legend. They should be verifiable by viewing the Aisling's legend.

(Tricky part: the private legend marks... Either need to exclude private marks, or think up some reliable verification method)

### Mentors
(Coming soon!)

### Hubaes
(Coming soon!)

### Divorces

### Gem Polishing
Awarded to Archer Dylanlan, who as of Deoch 201, has been involved in 6000 gem polishes since his birth in Deoch 51.

Surely no other Aisling has a higher count than this, right??

# Most Banked Light Belts
This award goes to the Aisling who currently owns the most Light Belt items in their bank account.

It is currently awarded to the Mighty Warrior Protein, who as of Deoch 201, has banked over 1,00 Light Belts since his birth in Deoch 108. That's more than 1 Light Belt per Deoch!! Incredible!!

Surely no other Aisling has a higher count than this.

(Screenshot excluded for brevity. You can certainly trust Protein - he would never lie!!)

# Speedruns
A collection of quests or bosses that were completed in the quickest time, perhaps?

Or maybe we should create a category on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/) for Darkages??
