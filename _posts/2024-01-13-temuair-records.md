This is just an early alpha side project focused on figuring out which Aisling holds various interesting records!

If you contact Protein, NaLyd, or Dylanlan about a record that you might own, they'll be happy to reward you with a bright, glowing prize!!

The hope is to have a colletion of verifiable, and beatable records, showcasing some of the most impressive Aislings across Temuair!

(( If anyone has any ideas about how to discourage botting for these records, I'm all ears!! ))

# Legend Marks

### Gem Polishing
Awarded to Archer Dylanlan, who as of Deoch 201, has been involved in 6000 gem polishes since his birth in Deoch 51.

Surely no other Aisling has a higher count than this, right??
