A curious Aisling named Bindo adventured across Temuair for awhile, and recorded his experiences! The story that this single Aisling told has reached over a million people worldwide on Youtube within a week, and has single-handedly revitalized interested in the game of Dark Ages. We were seeing ~60 players online in the weeks before Bindo's video, and within just a single week the online player count has reached over 500.

We've entered a completely new era of Dark Ages, where the lands are once again explored by curious Aislings going on hunts in the Mileth Crypt or Eastern Woodlands, learning about the various details of Temuair, and helping to build the homely community which has kept the game alive for so long. I don't think any of the original creators of Dark Ages expected it so still be running 26 years later, and gaining this much popularity!

Praise Bindo!
