Bindo returned to Temuair for a fun evening of games and prizes, organized by Solei and her wonderful event host team! Aislings participated in games of chance at Fioring Fiddles and Slot Machines, played a game of detective in Who's that Aisling, wrote some fire lyrics in Rap Battles, were judged on their swag outfits, and tried to follow chaotic instructions in Bindo Says.

## Fioring Fiddles

Aislings were tasked with finding the location of a blue or purple potion hidden underneath 5 red potions.

# Slot Machines

Three event hosts quickly swapped the color of the balloons they were holding, to mimic the randomness of a slot machine. Participants would then say when to Stop, and if the balloon colors matched up in certain ways, they'd win a prize!

# Who's that Aisling

Three volunteers each whispered a secret about themselves to the event host Phever. The host would then announce each secret to the crowd, and participants tried to match each secret to a volunteer.
