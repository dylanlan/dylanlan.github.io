The Mighty Protein had heard rumours of a terrible monster lurking within Mileth Crypt. Protein himself was way too stronk for such a quest, however, and would surely cause more destruction than was necessary.

So he decided to request that his younger brother find and slay the beast instead, to prove his mettle. His brother, Moose, quickly obliged and single-handedly destroyed the creature without any issues whatsoever (his words!).

The adventure began in Mileth Tavern, where the rumours of the terrible monster originated. Moose ran into a first hiccup almost immediately (he was, uh, missing a sword somehow), but it was just a tiny inconvenience.

Moose quickly found a sword, and was ready to fight!

Moose was ready for battle, and shouted a war cry that he had learned from his brother, Protein

Moose and Drangleic frantically explored the Mileth Crypt, looking for their feeble prey. Aha! They found the very spot from the rumours!

They were quickly attacked by the vicious beast, but it was no match for Moose's might.

Uhhh, er... as I was saying - the vicious beast was no match for Moose's endless skill!

Moose traps the beast around the pillar, expertly dodging every single attack that came his way!

Oh dear... Moose learns the importance of wearing a proper belt and necklace - and what happens when you misplace yours!

As well as the importance of carrying around certain potions that can revive a dying Aisling. Woops!

Moose finds himself in a strange place. Is Sgrios coming for him?! Oh, no, that is only "Nyarlathotep". Ah, of course! Good ol' Nyarly

![Moose Dead](/assets/img/adventures/crypt-terror-moose/moose-dead.png)

Moose gets revived from the dead, and feels slightly embarassed. But it was only a minor set back. He was very determined to finish what he started!

![Moose Revived](/assets/img/adventures/crypt-terror-moose/moose-revived.png)

Moose prepares for a second attempt, this time with more equipment. Crucially, he was able to locate an elemental belt, and Drangleic had a spare Dark Element Necklace that he could borrow.

Thanks for loaning all the gear, little Priest!

Moose considers a different battle plan. Are two swords always stronger than one??

![Moose Considers Backup](/assets/img/adventures/crypt-terror-moose/moose-battle-plan.png)

Moose notices another potential improvement to their battle plan. Perhaps he should learn another attack, which has been available to him for awhile!

Moose quickly doubles his attack power, by learning a second assail called Assault

Re-equipped, and all skilled-up, Moose and Drangleic return to the same spot, and happen upon some lovely loot that _someone_ had kindly left there

![Moose Considers Backup](/assets/img/adventures/crypt-terror-moose/moose-finds-loot.png)

Moose and Drangleic use their new battle plan. Along with the upgraded gear, the plan goes a lot _smoother_ - almost a difference between night and day!

The foul beast is finally slain!

![Moose Considers Backup](/assets/img/adventures/crypt-terror-moose/moose-success.png)

Moose takes a quick gander at his legend, before returning to the beggar to tell him the good news. A fresh scar remains, from their first attempt. Shoot! Sgrios reaches all, I guess.

Moose also notices that he has slain a similar beast in these parts, long ago. Moose does not remember much about that fateful encounter, but maybe he had left his old sword impaled in that creature.

![Moose Considers Backup](/assets/img/adventures/crypt-terror-moose/moose-legend-before.png)

Moose is somehow able to telepathically alert the beggar of the done deed!

![Moose Considers Backup](/assets/img/adventures/crypt-terror-moose/moose-finish-quest.png)

Moose takes another gander at his legend. Two terrors slain now! What a glorious day!

![Moose Considers Backup](/assets/img/adventures/crypt-terror-moose/moose-legend-after.png)

Moose decides to celebrate by investigating something about a mysterious Letter. But alas, Moose's Chrysalis is too Fragile, and he can progress no further on that quest. Maybe another day, Moose!

Today was quite the learning experience for young Moose. He won't be making those same mistakes again, I'm sure!
