The Suomi Troupe hosted some amazing events in February, for their annual Festival of Hearts!

# Lover's Garden

Participants in this event were allotted a 12x12 grid of land, to place various items into a fancy display. They would then have to explain how their creation was related to the "Fesitval of Hearts" theme, and would get judged for prizes.

# Improv

This event included a series of prompts to be used for 2-minute improvisation skits. The result was a lot of fun, awkwardness, and cringe!
