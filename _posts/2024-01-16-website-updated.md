Welcome to my personal fan website for Darkages! You can find various links on the left navigation menu:

- Adventure Log for some in-game screenshots
- Getting Started guide
- Guild for some information about a recently connected group of friends
- Letters for some in-game mailed letters
- Links to other Darkages fan sites
- Mileth College to learn about learning
- Misc for anything that doesn't fit nicely in a category
- Name Lottery for claiming a new character name
- Religion for some in-game lore (NEW: Deoch Mass!)
- Silly Games for some meta-games (NEW: World Records!)

NOTE: I'm planning to use a different website theme in the coming days. Do not be alarmed if everything looks very different soon!
