On this day, the Sradagan Fellowship was created by PaladinJack! Protein promptly joined afterwards.

The idea was spawned from a simple longing for more Temuairan adventures. More appreciation and enjoyment of the areas and quests that are often neglected in this day and age.

A want to return to a simpler time. A more homely time. A time when Temuair had more Temuairan-classed Aislings than Medenian.

And a burning desire to inspire in others the same feelings of nostalgia that both PaladinJack and Protein felt.

This is a memory of Protein with no guild. No fellowship. No family.

Shortly after the Fellowship had been created, Protein rushed to the Abel Tavern, to be admitted into the Fellowship by PaladinJack

Protein was prepared to follow this courageous leader, to the ends of Temuair

Aricin asked Protein if he was sure that he wanted to join Sradagan. It was a silly question - there was no doubt in Protein's mind.

Protein joined Sradagan on this day:

`201st Deoch, 3rd Moon, 7th Sun, at 5 p.m.`

Protein now had a family on his profile. A home.

Protein took one final look at PaladinJack's legend.
