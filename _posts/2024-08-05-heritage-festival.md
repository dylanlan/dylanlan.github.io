Aislings readied their mount and donned their armor for the Heritage jousting tournament! They hopped on their noble steed and charged head-on in battle for treasure and glory. (( A rock-paper-scissors style game! ))

# Mileth Fair Casino

Aislings stepped in line and sang their praises to Fiosachd as they awaited their turn to uncover hidden troves of treasure!

# Storytime

Aislings celebrated their heritage by bringing their most cherished recollections from Temuair and Medenia to Storytime, hosted by the Suomi Troupe and the Mileth College Literature department. Afterwards, they explore the community's current expectations and hopes for the future.

# Pirate Mafia

The town of Oren was overrun with pirates! Aislings tried to discover the disguised pirates before they assassinated the townsfolk! They had to flex their social deduction and manipulation skills by either voting out potential pirates, or assassinating Aislings in the dead of night, in the game of Mafia!

# Fashion Show

Aislings showcased their best heritage-inspired attire on stage. Among other criteria, judges paid close attention to the period appropriateness and any historical significance of their fashion choice.
