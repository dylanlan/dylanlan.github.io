Our very first quest together began at Lynith Beach. We had heard rumours of there being some buried treasure under the sea, but we didn't have any idea how to find it! Someone had told us that the nearby Pirate Ship might have some clues, however.

We climbed aboard the nearby Pirate Ship, donning a piece of clever disguise. Thankfully the crew had zero suspicions! We found our way to the Captain's quarters, and stumbled upon an intriguing map. It mentioned following some enigmatic clues underwater. But unfortunately, we were not fish-Aislings, we were merely regular-Aislings!

Being unable to breathe underwater, we had to enlist some outside help. A very kind Aisling named Wizadrian let us borrow his mystical jewelry, which allows an Aisling to breathe underwater - perfect! We ventured into Lynith Sea, confident in our abilities. However, disaster struck when we got surrounded by a gang of territorial Octopus and Starfish, who apparently wished for us to visit Sgrios! Unfortunately, our wizard got beat up quite badly, and we had to make a daring rescue. But thankfully we all survived to tell this wild tale.

We eventually made our way to the end of the clues, which led us to a pair of shovels in the sand. Lo and behold, a mysterious Oren Key was buried underneath! Some questions answered, but even more questions were created. The quest continues!
