After our recent religious visit, we decided to do another quest!

There had been stories of a dwarf named Throttler, deep in the Woodlands of the West. Rumours said that he needed help "taking care of" a rabid wolf. We didn't want this dangerous wolf sending poor innocent Aislings to meet Sgrios. So we happily volunteered as tribute!
