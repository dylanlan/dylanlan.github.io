The Suomi Troupe hosted some epic events for all the new players and veterans alike!


# Gear of the Gods

This event was hosted in the Oren Jungle and saw at least 150+ new players attend! Aislings who defeated monsters in the jungle were met with various rewards including gear from levels 1-99, gold bars, reg codes, and even a rare Dark College Uniform!
