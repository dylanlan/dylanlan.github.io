Dylanlan tried to be a tricky rogue, and double his chances at a random wheel raffle prize.

His efforts were thwarted, however, by someone with a poor taste in video games.

(Coming soon: more context)

There had been posts in a discord server about signing up your name for a Random Wheel Raffle Prize, for a chance to win 100k gold.

Dylanlan was short on cash, and decided to enter.

Dylanlan saw that there were multiple messages on different days, and decided to try signing up twice.

It was a higgling tactic that he had learned long ago, to help get him closer to that sweet, sweet mulah.

The original raffle was communicated as such:

He made sure to voice his interest in the raffle, so that a paper trail would exist, in case any Rangers started asking questions.

The raffle was posted a second time, and Dylanlan figured it was a good time to try out his Higgle tactic.

Dylanlan attempts to higgle. It appeared to succeed!

There were originally 11 unique names in the wheel, and Dylanlan was 2 of them. Only a sly increase from 9% odds, to 18%. Not great, not terrible.

Dylanlan tried pressing his luck even further to 27%, but alas, it was not successful. Oh well. 18% odds was still fairly reasonable.

The wheel got spun at the exact time indicated. Overall a very smoothly ran and fun event!

The odds were stacked against him, yet he still managed to win! Sneaky success!

(Some messages had gotten deleted in the aftermath, but the "I can roll it again if you don't want it" signifies that Dylanlan had won!)

But unfortunately, someone with very bad taste in games decided to point out the RNG manipulation, which promptly caused a re-roll.

The number of entrants was reset to 10 (no "duplicates"), and Dylanlan's odds were reset to 10%, same as everyone else.

And someone else ended up winning this time. Shoot!

Dylanlan had been anxiously awaiting the prize from the fair-and-rectangle raffle, after hearing of his win.

But instead, all he acquired was a taste for vengeance. (Not at the actual winner - it was someone else who complained!)

I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want.

If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money.

But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career.

Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.

If you give me a 100k gold loan now, that'll be the end of it.

I will not look for you, I will not pursue you.

But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.

You have my sword.
