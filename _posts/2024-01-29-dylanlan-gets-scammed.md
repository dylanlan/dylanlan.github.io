Dylanlan tried to be a tricky rogue, and double his chances at a random wheel raffle prize.

His efforts were thwarted, however, by someone with a poor taste in video games.

(Coming soon: more context)

There had been posts in a discord server about signing up your name for a Random Wheel Raffle Prize, for a chance to win 100k gold.

Dylanlan was short on cash, and decided to enter.

Dylanlan saw that there were multiple messages on different days, and decided to try signing up twice.

It was a higgling tactic that he had learned long ago, to help get him closer to that sweet, sweet mulah.

There were 20 names in the wheel, and Dylanlan was 4 of them. Only 20% odds, but not terrible.

The odds were stacked against him, yet he still managed to win!

But unfortunately, someone with very bad taste in games decided to point out the RNG manipulation, which promptly caused a re-roll.

Dylanlan had been anxiously awaiting the prize from the fair-and-rectangle raffle, after hearing of his win.

But instead, all he acquired was a taste for vengeance.
