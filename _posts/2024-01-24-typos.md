Here's a short list of some typos in Darkages game text:

TODO: get screenshots
- Can't deposit Yowien Territory gear to banker easily, need to append a "1" for some reason!
- Andorian Greaves show up under "Greases" category in bank?
- Loures Soliders?
- Jihad vs Jyhad in Pravat Sign?
- To deposit 'black pirate scarf' (male) you must say: "I will deposit black pirate bandana"?


If you find another typo in-game, just send a screenshot to me, and I'll give you a wonderful Light Belt!!
