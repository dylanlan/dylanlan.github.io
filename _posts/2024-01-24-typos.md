Here's a short list of some typos in Darkages game text:

- You can't deposit Yowien Territory gear in a bank easily. You need to append a "1" to the item names for some reason! (apparently someone used a glitch to duplicate too many of the original items!)

Coming Soon: more screenshots!
- Andorian Greaves show up under "Greases" category in bank?
- Loures Soliders?
- Jihad vs Jyhad in Pravat Sign?
- To deposit 'black pirate scarf' (male) you must say: "I will deposit black pirate bandana"?


If you find another typo in-game, just send a screenshot to me, and I'll give you a wonderful Light Belt!!
