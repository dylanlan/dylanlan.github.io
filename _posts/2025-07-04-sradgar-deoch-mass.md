# Full Sermon text

Alright, let's get started!

I ask that you please hold any questions until the end.

Welcome, everyone!
We are here to give thanks to Deoch, the God that
gifted us our Aisling Spark.
Deoch has created a huge number of fresh Sparks recently,
and we find ourselves in very exciting times!

I wanted to talk a bit about Deoch's allies today.
I find it very interesting that Deoch is allied with both
Glioca, the God of Love and Compassion, as well as
Sgrios, the God of Death and Decay.

Those two allies can sometimes seem quite
different from each other.
But indeed, they are both necessary for this world!
Death and decay both make room for new, loving life.
Glioca's compassion for others makes this world
worth living in.

And knowing that someday will be our last means that
our time spent together is that much more meaningful.
Life is fleeting - not permanent.
We must cherish the good times with each other
while we can, because we all end up at Sgrios, eventually.
It is the natural ebb and flow of life, for New Sparks
to enter the world, and Old Sparks to one day retire.

But to me, it feels like Sgrios has had a strong grip
on Temuair for quite some time.
Too many Aislings were in a deep slumber for too long.
Barely any New Sparks at all!
Much of Temuair was left deserted. Barren.
Decayed.

Sgrios has had a long turn of controlling Temuair.
But I believe his turn is over - for now.
We have entered a new age.
An age of Deoch and Glioca strengthening
their alliance once more!

Deoch has been busy awakening New Sparks, and
Glioca has been working to helping them feel
loved and supported in their adventures.

My message today is simply to embrace Glioca's alliance.
I believe it is our job to help these New Sparks that
Deoch has carefully created.
Help them understand and thrive in this
admittedly confusing and intimidating world.

Let us help them feel safe and appreciated!
Let us help them enjoy their time in Temuair,
in whichever ways that they might find enjoyment.
Let us kindle these New Sparks across Temuair
into a roaring fire!

I ask of you this:
If you see a New Spark wandering around, seemingly lost,
then offer to become their Guide or their Mentor.
Offer to teach them about this world!

Be prepared to help explain the endless quirks and
mysteries of these lands:
"How do I whisper?" "What class should I become?"
"What is labor?" "Which stats should I pick?"
"Which God should I worship?"
"How do I get to Suomi?" (heh)
"Where do I buy a Stilla?" (Mundanes please!!)

Remember that we were all this lost at one point,
and we received help on our own journeys.
So let's continue the cycle and help guide them on
their own fun path through Temuair.

But it's important to listen! Listen to what
frustrates and excites each Spark.
Try to help reduce their frustrations,
and empower their interests!

A mistake that I've seen happen a few times,
is for a Mentor to steer their Students towards a path
that the Mentor themselves enjoys, but not the student.
Or to steer new Students AWAY from paths that the
Mentor themselves dislikes. Such as using shortcuts
like those colorful chests that contain gobs of experience

I admit it can be a fine line between trying to reduce
needless frustrations, versus letting New Sparks
experience some of the tediousness of these lands.

But sometimes help can only be truly appreciated, by first
experiencing the pain that the help is intended to prevent
And certain experiences that an Old Spark might find
unenjoyable nowadays, perhaps was actually quite
exciting for them the first time they did it.

So let's not lead New Sparks away from their paths of
potential enjoyment, solely to avoid types of
experiences that Old Sparks might no longer enjoy.

For example, I've found inspiration in learning about
one New Spark's creative journey:
Pancakkes is determined to reach the 99th insight,
as a Peasant - without specializing in a class!
This is certainly a tough and demanding challenge,
especially for someone unfamiliar with these lands.

It's not a challenge that I myself would want to pursue.
But does that mean I should tell Pancakkes to just
pick a Class, since it makes everything easier?

No! We should help these New Sparks on the paths that
they choose for themselves, and help foster their
creativity and adventures!

If a New Spark is interested in slaying hoards of monsters
Teach them about the various quests and hunting
areas across these lands!
If they show a desire for friendly combat with other
Aislings, then let's show them the coliseum arena!

If they're interested in politics, get them in touch with
a local official that can teach them about Town Laws.
If they display a fascination with the religions of
Temuair, let's help point them towards a temple priest
that can help answer their questions.

If they're excited by the idea of Aisling organized events
then encourage them to attend a Troupe meeting!
And if nothing else, simply be there for them.
Let them know that they are loved and appreciated.

Thanks to Deoch, the world has shifted
away from Sgrios - for now.
And it's up to us Aislings to determine how much
Temuair swings towards Glioca.

Thank you for coming!
Mass is cast.
(( Happy 4th of July! ))

Let's light it up!!
