Protein, having recently reached his 93rd birth-deoch ((11 years old)), decided that it was finally an appropriate time to look into getting an education! Better late than never, people sometimes say~

Protein had been a bit busy hunting a rabid wolf, and ended up tardily barging into class, mid-lecture. Time management, Protein! It's important if you want to keep your grades up!
