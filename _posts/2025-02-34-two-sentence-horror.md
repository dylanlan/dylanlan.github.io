Laurier hosted a class about mini horror stories in two sentences! Here are the spooky stories that Aislings shared:


### Laurier #1

I can't move, breathe, speak or hear and it's so dark all the time.

If I knew I would be this only, I would have been cremated instead.


### Laurier #2

Extended mortal life, a feat only made possible by pledging one's soul to Chadul himself.

An insightful lecture on the Anaman Pact by Ramanayan Caesar, 200 Deoch old historian.

### Laurier #3

I can't wait to get this issue resolved.

*Submits a ticket*

### Laurier #4

This Suomi Inn was built on the blod and sweat of many Aislings, recounted innkeeper Viveka as she kindly escorted me down the dim wine cellar.

Suddenly, the door behind me slammed shut, the noise almost obscuring the hollow clatter of bones and skulls underneath my feet as I reached the landing.

### Solei

Andor Ants surround me from every corner I am sent to Sgrios.

No matter how many time I ask to return I am trapped in the darkness for all eternity.

### Solei #2

(( Purchases a reg code from the Darkages site ))

Kru: "This code has already been used."

### NaLyd #1

Thousands of Light Belts.

Zero Bags of Warranty.

### NaLyd #2

BioMagus's cute dog Ghislain :D

Not for sale. ;.;

### NaLyd #3

Oh boy, I can't wait to finish this Ciad quest! :DDD

"You decide to go back home."

### Mayheart

I was walking around the Mileth Inn late last night when a hand grabbed me from behind.

I turned around to find the hand was a withered husk belonging to a Nightguant from the dark maze.


### Ulli

"I'm so excited for my first ascension," I think as I cast my succubus hair into the altar.

As Ailred crashers me, I notice that I still have 25 finished talos in my backpack


### Ulli #2

Phew, I worked hard, and now I get to dye my noble garment!

Pure priests cannot learn to tailor.

### Phever

My satchel strains as I add one last piece of loot from this incredible hunt.

"I cannot hold anymore of your items."

### Ayeisha

Our party laughed as we left Kasmanium Mines, recounting the close calls we had in battle.

When someone asked ... "Wasn't there five of us?"

### Giller

I was walking in Lost Ruins 3 when suddenly I was surrounded by wolves.

With no way out and no one to help fight them off, suddenly I wake up holding a silvery wolf hair.
