# Full Class text

Hello everyone! Let's get started

For my session today I wanted to talk about memories!
(( Known as Screenshots ))

This will be mostly an informational session rather than
a full discussion, but feel free to whisper me if you
get confused about anything I say,
and I can try to clarify.

We'll try to cover what memories are, how to take them,
and what they can be useful for.

A memory is simply a visual snapshot of yourself and your
surroundings at a single moment in time.

They're often painted onto a parchment for easy viewing,
and stored away in your memory archive.
(( .bmp image files in your Dark Ages folder ))

Note that there are other types of memories that I plan to
talk about in another class: self portraits and journals.

Most Aislings are probably familiar with some sort of method
for taking memories.

(( Eg: print screen, snip & sketch, 3rd party programs,
or just taking a picture of your computer screen with
your phone, haha ))

But let's go over some innate Aisling memory-taking options.
Note that all innate methods will require permissions from
the Gods (( Run the game as administrator, or
install it outside of Program Files ))

There are two primary methods that can take memories:
1. Memory Function (( F12 ))
    
2. Memory Spell (( The button in the lower right corner
of the game client, next to the hotkeys question mark ))

The method I much prefer is the memory function (( F12 ))
It's super easy to use, can be quickly repeated, doesn't
distract you from using spells (( You don't need to
move the mouse )), and can also capture types of moments
that the Memory Spell cannot (eg: Mundane speech,
or viewing your own mail or a board post)

Whenever you take a memory, it is assigned an incrementing
reference number in your memory archive,
along with a curious prefix!

(( in your Dark Ages game folder, saved as lod001.bmp, etc,
where the "lod" prefix comes from the base version of
the game: Legend of Darkness ))

The style used for innate memories is a bit dated
(( Bitmap files, with extension ".bmp" )),
but there are types of magic that can convert them to a
more modern style (( eg: converters to .png files )).
Modern styles often make it easier to share with
other Aislings in aether realms (( eg: Discord ))

Ok, that covers how to create and find a memory!
But why might we even want to create memories?
Well, they have many uses!

Their best use in my opinion is simply reflecting upon
one's own experiences. To share epic adventures and
moments with others, remember which Aislings you've
befriended or perhaps become enemies with, solidify your
fashion choices, or just to feel a bit of pure nostalgia.

For all the New Sparks attending today, I HIGHLY recommend
that you take some memories of your adventures.
You might end up kicking yourself in a Cycle or two when you
realize you didn't take enough memories of important moments

My sibling, Dylanlan, sadly didn't take a single lasting
memory of himself until he was already a Master :(

But another important use for memories is in town politics.
For example, Guards can take memories of Aislings breaking
the law, and submit them as evidence against that Aisling.

And a fun use for memories is for the recently revived
"Memory of the Cycle" contest, which can grant marks of
Nobility to its winners. It's a super fun contest and it
ends up unearthing all sorts of wacky and interesting
memories, so I highly recommend taking some for it!

Check the Events of Temuair for details (( Press "w" ))
(( More info here: novus-imperia.com/college/mem.htm ))

Phew, ok! I think we'll end it there for now.
I hope that was a good introduction to memories!

In my next session I hope to talk about some Amnesia Curses,
which can prevent creating memories!

If you arrived late, please whisper me for tardy credit.

Alright, class has ended, thanks for coming!
I'll stick around a bit if anyone has any questions
