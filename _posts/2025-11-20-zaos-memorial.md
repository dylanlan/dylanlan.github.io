Temuair was shocked and saddened to hear about the sudden passing of Zaos. We'll sorely miss his hilarious antics, comments, and desire to stab all bots. Phever and Brinx organized a memorial at Loures Castle, and Zaos's brother Domou was able to attend.

His family has set up a gofundme if you're wishing to donate: <a href="https://gofund.me/164985858">https://gofund.me/164985858</a>

Rest in peace, Zaos <3
