Unora has launched its open Beta! It's a private server of Darkages with various tweaked / added mechanics and Quality of Life improvements!

## Description

Welcome to Unora, a realm where the echoes of the Great Divine War still resonate through the land, sky, and seas. In this mystical world, players embark on a journey through a landscape shaped by the cataclysmic Battle of Elemental Harmony, where gods clashed in a display of unimaginable power. The legacies of Ignatar, Geolith, Zephyra, and Aquaedon are woven into the very fabric of Unora, offering a rich tapestry of lore and adventure. As players explore this diverse and dynamic environment, they will encounter remnants of the fallen deities, each area reflecting the essence and turmoil of the gods who once presided over them. The aftermath of the war has left a world filled with mystery, conflict, and a delicate balance maintained by the remaining goddesses – Theselene, Serendael, Skandara, and Miraelis.

The Unora Project invites players to delve into a unique experience, blending elements from Nexus TK, LoD, and DarkAges, to forge a distinct gaming adventure. Our open beta is an opportunity for enthusiasts to immerse themselves in a world rich in lore and complexity. We are dedicated to creating an engaging, player-driven narrative, where every discovery, from items and skills to spells and dialogues, contributes to the unfolding story. Your participation, feedback, and insights are invaluable in refining Unora, ensuring an immersive and captivating experience for all. Join us in shaping a world where the remnants of a divine war pave the path for new legends and adventures.

There are expansive "Wilderness" areas which allow you to walk directly between towns. They're often littered with various enemies, such as this giant Cow!

Or this giant Ram!

One of the many amazing Quality of Life improvements is that fishing is no longer a painful manual activity! Simple equip a fishing pole, have some bait in your inventory, and your Aisling will slowly fish over time, even if you're away from your keyboard! Fishing can help gain experience, as well as an ever-increasing legend mark!
