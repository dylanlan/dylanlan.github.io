## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of my initial adventures in Unora!

There were a bunch of Mileth Crypt hunting parties happening!

We played a custom arena mode called "Hidden Havoc", which involved trying to dodge both hidden Aislings and the spreading lava

There are expansive "Wilderness" areas which allow you to walk directly between towns. They're often littered with various enemies, such as this giant Cow!

Or this giant Ram!

One of the many amazing Quality of Life improvements is that fishing is no longer a painful manual activity! Simple equip a fishing pole, have some bait in your inventory, and your Aisling will slowly fish over time, even if you're away from your keyboard! Fishing can help gain experience, as well as an ever-increasing legend mark!

These screenshots only scratch the surface of the game! Many more adventures await!
