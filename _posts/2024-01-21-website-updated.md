NOTE: I recently updated the design of this site - please let me know if anything looks broken on your device! Thanks!

Welcome to my personal fan website for Darkages! You can find some links at the top of the site, or in a 3-line "hamburger" menu:

- About: a brief introduction for myself
- Get Started: a guide for joining this crazy game!
- Adventure Log: various new (2024+) in-game screenshots and narrations
- Memories: a collection of old in-game screenshots, mostly from 2006-2010


(Coming Soon:)
- Links: other immensely useful Darkages websites
- Misc: various things that don't fit into a nice category yet
- Projects: a few fun games / projects that I want to work on
